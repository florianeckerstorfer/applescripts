## About

Random collection of AppleScripts I've created. With created I mean that I copied and modified scripts I found on forums. Sadly I don't have this sources anymore.

These scripts where mostly made to be executed using keyboard shortcuts and [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/).
